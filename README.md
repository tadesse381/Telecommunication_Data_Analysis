## User Overview or Market Analysis
Graph a)Â  and b) shows that from the top 3 manufacturers of handset the Apple is leading , and the phone which sold on number one is Huawei B528S-23A .
But next to Huawei most of the customers use Apple Handset.
Since Apple is highly manufactured and it is also used next to Huawei, the marketing department of Telcco should sell the apple handsets in order to be productive.
Therefore, the company will generate a good income from selling the Apple handset.

As it is indicated on graph c) the users are more engaged on Game. 
To the Maximum 4,518,036 bytes of data volume is used for the gaming purpose.

This shows that company is profitable in future time. 
Therefore, the company should emphasis on gaming application.
